# README
This is an experimental project to re-develop the Elision term rewriter
in C++.  Nothing here is even remotely stable, or usable by anyone other
than the developer, and you should **beware**.

If you want to help, please feel free to fork and Make Things Better, but
please also join the project so we can all Work Together for the Greater
Good.

The original Elision project source was donated to Oak Ridge National
Laboratory for use in their Hyperion system, but this code has //not//
been donated and is not for such use.

So that's it.
